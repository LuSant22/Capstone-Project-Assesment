# Best features recommendation for Airbnb in Amsterdam

# Introduction/Business Problem


Considering that each year the number of clients of this service is increasing, it is a good option to start now in this business. There are many reasons why people prefer to stay in an Airbnb than in a hotel, for example the price is one of the most common reasons for long stays because normally hosts offer special prices for those situations, also people like to stay in a house for the experience of living in the place that they’re visiting. So, with the boom of Airbnb, many entrepreneurs want to get inside the business and many of them do not know where to start. Although there are many competitors in great cities like Amsterdam it stills being a great idea to enter in this field due to the large amount of visitors that the city receives all year. 

The main problem is not that they may don’t have a house or an apartment because they rent one to start an Airbnb business, the main problem is that they do not know where has to be located and mainly which characteristics do the house is better to have in order to have more revenue and a large quantity of clients during the year.
