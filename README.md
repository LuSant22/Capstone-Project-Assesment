# Introduction/Business Problem


With the boom of Airbnb, many entreprenurs want to get inside the business and may of them do not know where to start.
The main problem is that they may not have a house or apartment but they want to buy or rent one to start an Airbnb business but they do not know where, so I will make an analysis in the Airbnb's inside the city of Amsterdam within many features that will give a 
recommendation about which zone is better to buy/rent a house and start an airbnb business based on ratings, cost and other features.

The target audience will be the new entreprenurs that want to start to look in which area is better for this kind of business,
although the property is an important factor, the area is also important because it can result in the success or failure of the project.
