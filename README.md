# Best location recommendation for Airbnb in Amsterdam

# Introduction/Business Problem


With the boom of Airbnb, many entrepreneurs want to get inside the business and may of them do not know where to start.
The main problem is that they may not have a house or apartment but they want to buy or rent one to start an Airbnb business but they do not know where, so I will make an analysis in the Airbnb's inside the city of Amsterdam within many features that will give a 
recommendation about which zone is better to buy/rent a house and start an airbnb business based on ratings, cost and many other features that will be explained in the next week submission.

The target audience will be the new entrepreneurs that want to start to look in which area is better for this kind of business,
although the property is an important factor, the area is also important because it can result in the success or failure of the project.
This project will be really useful in real life with its implementation in other cities arround the world, a great tangible benefit can be achieved with the use of data. 

# About the data

The data is an open-source non-commercial licensed with many features about Airbnb in the city of Amsterdam extracted from http://insideairbnb.com/ that offers really valuable information about the topic. This dataset contains information of more than 20k airbnbs around Amsterdam, so the metrics will be accurate, but it will be necessary to clean and prepare the data.
